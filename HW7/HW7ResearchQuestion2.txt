Homework 7 - Research Question 2

Research why you're able to call the default implementation of a method in
an interface with some weird syntax. Here's the code:

public class blah{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		A a = new A();
		a.someMethod();
	}
}

interface myinterface{
	default public void sayHello(){
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}
}

class A implements myinterface{
	public void someMethod(){
		myinterface.super.sayHello();
	}
}

Rationale:
Within Java, you only extend from one class, in other words single inheritance.
However, with interfaces, a single class can implement many interfaces therefore there is a multiple inheritance tree.

To call a specific invocation of a method in an interface (let's say you try to override, or create a method in a class with the same name),
Calling super in this sense is a keyword referring to the interface rather than the parent class. Default methods are also concrete methods rather than abstract.
